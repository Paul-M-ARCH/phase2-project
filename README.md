# Phase 2 Project: Analyzing Movie Trends - What Films Perform Best at the Box Office?

## Overview
This project explores factors that contribute to a movie's box office success. Using data analysis and statistical models, we identify key trends and relationships between production budgets, genres, and audience reception.

## Business Understanding
The company sees major corporations creating original video content and wants to join the industry. However, they lack expertise in movie production. This project explores box office trends to provide actionable insights for launching a successful film studio. Key questions include:

- What genres perform best in terms of worldwide gross revenue?

- How does production budget impact revenue?

- Are factors like runtime, release year, and user ratings significant predictors of box office success?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
The dataset includes movie details such as worldwide gross revenue, production budgets, genres, ratings, and release years. We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and used statistical methods to validate key insights.  
### Key Columns Used For Analysis:
- Movie - Movie title  
- Start_year - Year of initial screening 
- Runtime_minutes - Duration of the film  
- Genres - Genre of the film  
- Averagerating - Average popularity rating of a film  
- Numvotes - Number of voters of a particular film  
- Release_date - Official date of release to the public  
- Production_budget - Cost of making the movie  
- Domestic_gross - Revenue brought in from the domestic market  
- Worldwide_gross - Revenue brought in from the global market
